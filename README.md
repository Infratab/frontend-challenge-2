                                                         REMIND ME
                                                         
RemindMe is a simple app that provides API for saving reminder.

For using this:

1. Clone the repo
2. go to remind_me directory - `cd frontend-challenge-2/remind_me` 
3. run - `vagrant up`
4. run - `vagrant ssh`
5. Now you can access API's at localhost:3000
6. Token authentication is being used, to access browsable api use [ModHeader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=en)
to set authorization header for the request. It allows you to set headers for your request. You can set the token authtoken there where "Name" would be "Authorization" and "Value" would be "Token <your_token>"
